# How to Start the Backend Server

## Quick Steps:

1. **Open the Shell**
   - Look at the left sidebar in Replit
   - Click the **grid/menu icon** at the bottom (labeled "All tools")
   - Click **"Shell"**

2. **Run this command in the Shell:**
   ```
   cd /home/runner/workspace/backend && npm start
   ```

3. **Wait for this message to appear:**
   ```
   Server running on port 3000
   ```

4. **IMPORTANT: Keep the Shell window OPEN**
   - Do NOT close it
   - Do NOT press Ctrl+C
   - The backend must keep running

5. **Try signing in/creating account in your app**
   - Go back to the web browser
   - Try "Create Account" or "Sign In"
   - It should work now!

## If it still doesn't work:
- Check that you see "Server running on port 3000" in the Shell
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Refresh the web page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)

## To keep backend running after testing:
Open a SECOND Shell window:
- Click "All tools" again → Click "Shell"
- This opens a new Shell
- You can now use one for commands and keep the backend running in the other
